This lab consisted of developing 3 RISC-V functions. These functions utilize the stack and stack pointer to store and retrieve variables between branching calls, especially the last recursive function.

Function 1 sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

Function 2 concatenates 2 strings together, allocating memory using malloc

Function 3 manually calculates the Fibonacci term at location "n", for any given n

Function 4 completes a binary search on an array of integers and a given number to find.
